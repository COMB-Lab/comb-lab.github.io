I am a tenure-track assistant professor in [Computer Science at California State University, Los Angeles,](https://www.calstatela.edu/) interested in teaching and research in computational sciences with applications in drug discovery. I develop machine learning, scalable optimization algorithms, and high performance computing to understand the structure and function of biomolecular systems. 
 
I was a biomedical research intern at [Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine (SCGPM)](https://med.stanford.edu/scgpm.html) in the summer of 2018 and a graduate research assistant at [Virginia Tech Advanced Research Computing (ARC)](https://arc.vt.edu/) in 2018-2019. Currently, I am a faculty member of the [Biomedical Engineering (BME) Minor Program](https://www.calstatela.edu/ecst/biomedical-engineering) at Cal State LA, a co-director of the [NSF PREC program at](https://www.calstatela.edu/centers/prec) Cal State LA, and an official developer of [AMBER,](https://ambermd.org/) an open-source software package for molecular dynamics simulation.
